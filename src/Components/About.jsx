Then I went to <b>Gonda</b> city in 2008 with my uncle and aunty. In Gonda I studied for 12 years and completed my schooling from <b>Sri Raghukul Vidya Peeth</b> in 2020. After 12th durring covid period i had given JEE Main exam and i qualify it but not get sufficient marks to get a colleage, so I decided to take a drop year for preparation of JEE exam.
